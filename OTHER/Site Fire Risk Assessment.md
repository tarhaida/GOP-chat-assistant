| Project:  Location / address:  Nearest Fire Station: |
| **Construction Method: (Tick the boxes applicable)**  Steel frame: Masonry:  Timber frame: Concrete: |
| **Are the following services live?**  Electricity: Y/N Date: Gas: Y/N Date: Water: Y/N Date: |
| **Fire Hazards:**  **Identify all sources of fuel on site.**  Combustible - Wood Paper / cardboard Textiles / soft furnishings Oils / Grease  Flammable – Petrol Propane / Acetylene Diesel Oil Solvent |
| **Controls:**  All combustible materials (timber, plywood, OSB), are stored away from sources of ignition  All combustible waste material is located in either a general waste skip or recyclable waste skip.

Any flammable waste material, including discarded gas cylinders and liquid containers is hazardous waste and is segregated in a separate skip prior to disposal. |
| **Fire Hazards:**  **Identify all sources of ignition on site.**  Hot Work – Propane IR heaters Disc or chain saw / Angle grinder  Heaters (Welfare Unit) Halogen site lights  Refuelling – Portable tools Plant / generator |
| **Controls:**  Hot work procedure;  Operators trained in the safe use of propane fuelled equipment and portable cutting tools.  All equipment is visually inspected before use and quarantined if faulty.  All hot work is stopped 1 hour before the site closes and a visual inspection carried out by the site supervisor.  A fire extinguisher is located close by the person carrying out the hot work.  Welfare unit heater ;  Kept clear of obstructions and combustible material (wet clothes, furniture)  Switched off when not required.  Controlled with a thermostat.  Electrically safety tested annually when the welfare unit is tested.  Refuelling;  Designated safe fuelling point away from hot work and combustible waste, when filling portable tools with petrol.  Drip tray used in case of spillage and a spill kit available in the site cabin.  Petrol quantity limited to 20Ltr jerry can or 4.5Ltr container kept in a locked site container when not required. |
| **Fire Hazards:**  **Other sources of ignition.**  Smoking – Designated area on site No Smoking Permitted on site  Cooking / food warming (Welfare unit) –  Arson / deliberate fire setting. |
| **Controls:**  The designated safe smoking area is located by the welfare unit with a lidded metal container for discarded cigarette ends**.**  Cooking / food warming – Microwave oven only, no hot plates  Arson - The site perimeter securely fenced using Heras Fencing Panels, gate secured with chain and padlock.  Out of hour’s security provided by Mobile Security Patrol  No visitors / contractors permitted on site unless they have been inducted and signed the visitor log. |
| **Persons at risk:**  Employees Contractors Visitors Neighbouring properties |
| **Controls:**  Employees receive a site specific safety induction given by the site supervisor when first arriving on site. Employees also sign in and out of the site register daily.

If required the site supervisor or his deputy in his absence, will contact the emergency services by using his mobile ‘phone to dial 999.  All employees received a site safety induction including the fire procedure when first arriving on site  There a visitor log in the site cabin for ALL visitors and contractors to sign in & out when visiting.  ***\*Any incident involving or causing a fire is to be recorded on an Accident / Incident report form and reported to the Contracts Director and SHE Advisor for investigation***  **Portable fire-fighting equipment**  Two 6kg Class AB Foam extinguishers located by the site cabin and one 6kg Class AB in the equipment container to be taken to the point of any hot work.  The extinguishers are serviced annually by a trained competent employee.  Check;   * Has the extinguisher been serviced within the last 12 months (check date on label) Y/N * Is the safety pin security seal in place and un-damaged. Y/N * Is the pressure gauge needle is in the ‘green’ zone.
