# INTRODUCTION

This policy is available to access by all employees and officers of GOP Co-Living Ltd and any other interested person that may be affected by our work or activities.

Electronic copies can be provided on request.

All employees are encouraged to fully familiarise themselves with this policy and accompanying documentation. Employees are required to confirm that they are aware of and understand the contents of this policy. If they are unsure of or do not understand any aspect, they should speak to their Manager at the earliest opportunity for clarification.

We ensure that this policy is managed effectively by regularly monitoring the policy (at least annually) and revising when necessary. Revisions and amendments may be necessary to reflect legislative change, or changes that have taken place within GOP Co-Living Ltd. Employees are informed when revisions or amendments are made.

GOP Co-Living Ltd encourages all employees to inform the Management of any aspect of this policy which they consider to be inadequate, ineffective, or in any other way unsuitable; with a view to ensuring that this policy is maintained as a true working document.

GOP Co-Living Ltd accepts that the responsibility for health, safety and welfare is ultimately with the Managing Director, and accepts the duty under law to provide a working environment that is free from danger or hazard, so far as is reasonably practicable.

**Effective Health, Safety and Welfare management is a priority and will never be compromised for any other objectives.**

# POLICY STATEMENT OF INTENT

GOP Co-Living Ltd believes that the effective management of health and safety is an essential element within its overall business plan. An effective and practical health and safety ethos is reflected in high productivity and quality standards.

We engage the services of Rhino Safety Limited, an external Health & Safety consultancy, to provide us with expert advice, support and guidance. This demonstrates our commitment to the continuous monitoring and improvement of health, safety and welfare in our workplace, with a view to achieving high standards and best practices.

We recognise that our employees are our most important asset, and we are wholly committed to protecting their health, safety and welfare in our workplace at all times. We will also safeguard any other people who may be affected by our work activities.

We recognise that from an economic viewpoint, early prevention is not only better; it is also more cost effective than a later cure. There is no conflict between profit and safety considerations; they go hand in hand. High health and safety standards make sound commercial sense. Health and safety is never compromised for any other objectives.

We are committed to full compliance with all health and safety legislation. Whenever it is reasonably practicable and appropriate, we will strive to set standards beyond our statutory obligations. We will monitor and review our processes and procedures on an ongoing basis, in order that potential improvements in our health and safety standards can be recognised and implemented.

## Our intentions:

* To identify, assess and proactively manage the health, safety and welfare hazards and risks that are associated with our business; and to ensure that all our employees (and any other person who may be affected by our work activities) are aware of and understand those hazards, risks, and control measures. Hazards and risks will be prevented, reduced or controlled to an acceptable level to ensure the potential for incidents and accidents is minimised.
* To require any sub-contractors or other person working in our workplace to prove their health and safety competence; and also require them to identify, assess, manage and communicate any health and safety hazards and risks associated with their work that may impact on our work activities.
* To actively involve our employees in consultation on matters affecting health, safety and welfare, and to promote and demonstrate open and transparent communication.
* To provide our employees with the appropriate information, education and supervision to ensure that they are competent in their duties.
* To provide and maintain safe resources and equipment; and provide adequate and effective control measures to identify, assess and manage the health and safety risks related to our work activities, our resources and our equipment.
* To do everything that is reasonably practicable to prevent incidents, accidents and instances of work-related illnesses; including by providing training and education to employees where appropriate.
* To review and (where appropriate) revise this policy regularly, and to assess its ongoing effectiveness.
* Ultimately, to maintain a safe and healthy working environment.

# ARRANGEMENTS

The following sections detail the arrangements we implement to effectively minimise, control and manage the risks that we have identified as having the most potential to cause serious harm associated with our workplace and activities.

We recognise that there are other ways in which harm may be caused during our work activities, even when the harm may not be significant. As with general daily life, there are very few areas that are entirely free from risk. We expect all employees, subcontractors, and others who may be involved in or affected by our work activities to take all reasonable care to prevent any harm, irrespective of how minor the harm may seem, and to engage in sensible precautions where necessary; even where such precautions are not explicitly identified within this document.

#

# BEHAVIOURAL SAFETY

## SAFETY CULTURE

It is the policy of GOP Co-Living Ltd that a positive Health and Safety culture is promoted throughout the company. Safety culture means “the way we do things around here with regards to Health and Safety” and is a collective ownership of Health and Safety responsibilities through every level of the company structure, including all management and employees.

We recognise that the behaviour of employees is a significant factor in maintaining a positive safety culture. Management must embody and demonstrate positive safety attitudes and practices to model the behaviours we want employees to replicate. We believe in monitoring behaviour as a proactive management strategy, because identifying at-risk behaviours and taking action to correct them results in fewer accidents due to early identification of problems. Therefore, we encourage employees to proactively identify and report any and all unsafe practices they may observe in the workplace.

## Reasons for Poor Behaviour

* Taking short cuts to save time.
* The person is a habitual risk taker or has a higher risk tolerance.
* Misunderstanding (being unaware or having a low perception of risk).
* Not updating documents such as risk assessments or safe systems of work to reflect changes that may have happened to processes, people, equipment or environment.
* Misinformation or poor communication (e.g. inadequate training, lack of regular toolbox talks, not reporting accidents or near misses).
* An attitude of “We’ve always done it this way” or being resistant to change.

## Management Controls

* Review documentation as necessary, ensuring that any changes are communicated to employees.
* Ensure all employees receive sufficient training and supervision for their activities.
* Ensure regular safety communication with employees; often employees have the best solutions to safety problems because of their intimate knowledge of the job.
* Identify and correct unsafe behaviours and encourage employee to recognise and report any unsafe behaviours themselves.
* ALWAYS lead by example.

## Employee Responsibilities

* Ensure you read and understand all risk assessments relating to your job.
* Take on board the training provided and make us aware of anything you may not have understood.
* Learn to recognise and report unsafe behaviours, don’t walk by something that could potentially be dangerous.
* Communicate with us about your job and any improvements you think can be made; we understand that workers often have the best solutions.
* If you think “this doesn’t feel right” or “this doesn’t make sense”, STOP and reconsider the task, and involve other members of your team when finding solutions.
* Report any circumstances that you feel will put yourself or others in danger.

# CONSTRUCTION (DESIGN & MANAGEMENT) REGULATIONS 2015

Cross Tree are the investment company and GOP are the Operational team

The Aims of the Regulations are to help everyone:

* Sensibly plan the work so the risks involved are managed from start to finish;
* Have the right people for the right job at the right time;
* Co-operate and co-ordinate work with others;
* Have the right information about the risks and how they are being managed;
* Communicate this information effectively to those who need to know;
* Consult and engage with workers about the risks and how they are being managed.

## CONSTRUCTION PHASE PLAN

The client must ensure that a construction phase plan for the project is prepared before the construction phase begins. The plan outlines the health and safety arrangements, site rules and specific measures concerning any work involving the particular risks. For single-contractor projects that GOP Co-Living Ltd are working on, we will ensure we prepare the plan. For projects involving more than one contractor, it is the principal contractor’s duty.

## THE HEALTH AND SAFETY FILE

A health and safety file is only required for projects where the client is non-domestic, and involving more than one contractor. The client must ensure that the principal designer prepares a health and safety file for their project; where the principal designer's appointment finishes before the end of the project, the principal contractor must take on responsibility for ensuring that the file is reviewed, updated and revised for the remainder of the project. Its purpose is to ensure that, at the end of the project, the client has information that anyone carrying out subsequent maintenance or construction work on the building will need to be aware of in order to be able to plan and carry out the work safely and without risks to health.

## NOTIFIABLE PROJECTS

A project is notifiable if the construction work on a construction site is scheduled to:

* Last longer than 30 working days and have more than 20 workers working simultaneously at any point in the project, or;
* Exceeds 500 person days.

Where a project is notifiable, the client must give notice in writing to the HSE as soon as is practicable before the construction phase begins and the F10 must be displayed on site.

## COOPERATION & COORDINATION

Good co-operation and co-ordination of work between all of the parties involved in a project is essential if risks are to be identified early on and properly controlled. A team approach actively encouraged from an early stage involving the client, designers, contractors and even manufacturers who work closely together will often produce the best results, this allows the client, designers, contractors and facilities management experts, to work together and identify the best solution for the client’s needs, taking account of the practicalities of construction work, future maintenance and the ongoing use of the site. Even on projects where it is not practical to formally establish an integrated team, the client, designer, contractors and others involved in the project still need to work together and we will there liaise and co-operate with all such parties as and when necessary.

We are fully aware of the need to communicate the scope of our works and in particular the risks and hazards associated with our works, whilst planning the implementation of our work around that of others to avoiding creating a hazard to others.

Where potential problems are not identified until the actual work has started they can often be much more difficult and costly for all concerned to manage. Good, timely communication is therefore essential to co-operation and co-ordination of activities.

Information about risks and precautions needs to be shared sensibly (i.e. relevant information, not everything) when it is needed to plan and manage work. Drawings can be used to highlight the significant hazards or unusual work sequences identified by designers, with advice on where to find more information.

This will typically be achieved through pre-start meetings, inductions, regular informal weekly/daily co-ordination meetings between the respective parties and through the exchange of information such as risk assessments where this is deemed necessary.

## CLIENT

When GOP Co-Living Ltd acts as the operations team during a project, we will ensure that we make suitable arrangements for managing their project, enabling those carrying it out to manage health and safety risks in a proportionate way. These arrangements include:

* Appointing the contractors and designers to the project (including the principal designer and principal contractor on projects involving more than one contractor) while making sure they have the skills, knowledge, experience and organisational capability.
* Allowing sufficient time and resources for each stage of the project.
* Making sure that any principal designer and principal contractor appointed carry out their duties in managing the project.
* Making sure suitable welfare facilities are provided for the duration of the construction work.
* Maintaining and reviewing the management arrangements for the duration of the project.
* Providing pre-construction information to every designer and contractor either bidding for the work or already appointed to the project.
* Ensuring that the principal contractor or contractor (for single contractor projects) prepares a construction phase plan before that phase begins.
* Ensuring that the principal designer prepares a health and safety file for the project and that it is revised as necessary and made available to anyone who needs it for subsequent work at the site.

# CONTRACTOR & SUPPLY CHAIN SELECTION

GOP Co-Living Ltd has adopted a policy that we will only work with contractors and suppliers who can demonstrate and validate their commitment to high standards of health and safety. As such, all contractors and suppliers will be selected via a process that substantiates their competency.

## Management Controls

* Wherever possible, contractors and suppliers are selected through seeking recommendations from trusted industry peers; and the development of a good working relationship over many years.
* Contractors are required to submit documentation including their Health and Safety Policy, Risk Assessments, Method Statements, and valid Insurance Certificates.
* Contractors are required to provide evidence of the Training and Experience of their staff.
* Contractors and suppliers are required to provide evidence of relevant industry accreditations that they hold.
* Contractors are required to provide details of their Accident Records and any relevant prosecutions.
* For any contractors' work equipment used on the premises, safe procedures for use and maintenance are expected to be followed, to meet the requirements of the relevant Work Equipment regulations.
* Suppliers are selected who can meet our requirements in respect of cost, specification, sustainability and programme.

## Employee Responsibilities

* You must adhere to and comply with all management controls and report any concerns.

# C.O.S.H.H.

C.O.S.H.H. stands for the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health. In the course of our work activities, employees may be exposed to, or required to use, substances that may be hazardous to health if proper control measures are not adhered to.

## SUBSTANCES HAZARDOUS TO HEALTH INCLUDE:

* Any chemicals that have to be labelled with the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals in accordance with the REACH Regulations (eg. ‘flammable’, ‘toxic’, ‘harmful’, ‘irritant’ or ‘corrosive’.
* Substantial quantities of airborne dust of any kind.
* Harmful micro-organisms.
* Any other substance that creates a comparable health hazard.

Certain substances, such as asbestos and lead, are covered by specific Regulations.

## Management Controls

* We ensure that we have the current datasheets for all substances hazardous to health that we use during our operations.
* These substances are assessed, and the correct control measures implemented.
* All the hazardous substances we hold are stored in a suitable safe location.
* Where possible, we eliminate the hazard at source. For example; dust extraction on tools, wetting down, LEV’s etc.
* Where appropriate, suitable Personal Protective Equipment is provided for use when dealing with hazardous substances, and staff are instructed that they must wear it.

## Employee Responsibilities

* Always wear the Personal Protective Equipment provided and follow the controls detailed on the risk assessments.

# DISPLAY SCREEN EQUIPMENT

A user of Display Screen Equipment is defined as a person who "habitually uses display screen equipment as a significant part of their normal work". Generally, this means an employee who uses DSE more or less continually during the working day (*or for continuous spells of an hour or more at a time*); and who has to transfer information quickly to or from the screen.

## Management Controls

* Workstations within our offices will be assessed with a view to reducing the risks associated with DSE.
* The assessment will be reviewed when; hardware/software is modified or changed; the workstation is modified; the time spent using equipment increases; there is a change in task, the workstation is relocated, or the lighting modified.
* We ensure that there is sufficient space for the operator to move, change position, and store documents.
* We ensure that lighting is suitable and sufficient to reduce glare and reflections.
* We assess ancillary equipment to ensure noise does not create excessive disturbance.
* Checks are made to ensure that excessive heat is not produced by ancillary equipment.
* We ensure that humidity is maintained at a suitable and adequate level.

## Employee Responsibilities

* Use the equipment provided and adjust it correctly.
* Report any concerns to management.
* Complete a new Display Screen Equipment (DSE) assessment if your workstation changes in any way.

## EYE TESTS

The provision of eyesight tests for present and future users of DSE is available. Present users shall be provided, on request, with appropriate eye tests. It is advised that future users are tested before they become users.

Repeat testing is to be at the discretion of the optometrist conducting the test. However, there is no compulsion on employees to undergo tests against their will.

Where the user experiences difficulties with DSE the employer should provide eye/eyesight tests as soon as possible. GOP Co-Living Ltd will meet the cost of providing a full eye / eyesight test with an optometrist or doctor; and will contribute towards the cost of any corrective equipment (such as spectacles) that are prescribed specifically for use with DSE.

# DRUGS AND ALCOHOL

GOP Co-Living Ltd recognises that both the health of the individual and the safety of the workplace are paramount in achieving the goals of the business as a whole. Employees can be at risk from misuse of alcohol and drugs, both cause effects on individuals which can manifest themselves in the workplace leading to increased risk of accidents, sickness absence, and disciplinary problems and reduced efficiency.

**Under this policy GOP Co-Living Ltd requires that:**

* We are compliant with relevant current legislation relating to substance abuse i.e. The Health & Safety at Work etc Act 1974, the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, the Transport and Works Act 1992 and where relevant the Railways (Safety Critical Work) Regulations 1994.
* GOP Co-Living Ltd employees, consultants, contractors or sub-contractors must not try to report for work if they are unfit through alcohol, illegal drugs or prescription drugs.
* When at work employees must not consume alcohol or illegal drugs or be in possession of these items nor be involved in the sale or distribution of alcohol or illegal drugs on any company premises.
* Measures to prevent any person attending work under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs may include testing at pre-employment, post incident or ‘for cause’ and random unannounced testing.
* Anyone identifying themselves as having a problem will be supported positively and confidentially with guidance, and information and where applicable referral for treatment to overcome the alcohol and/or drugs problems. **Help must be requested prior to testing**.
* Anyone suspected of being under the influence through the use of alcohol and/or illegal drugs that tests positive will be in breach of this policy. They will also be subject to suspension from work, full investigation and potentially disciplinary action under the process.
* Those employees failing to consent for testing could face disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.

# EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

It is the responsibility of the Director to ensure that key staff are prepared to deal with an emergency situation and are aware of the correct procedures to follow in the event of such a situation occurring. This ensures that the health, safety and welfare of all staff and any other persons is protected in emergency situations.

## Management Controls

* Ensure that suitable procedures are produced and communicated to all relevant parties.
* Ensure that training for those with specific responsibilities is undertaken.
* Conduct drills as appropriate.
* Review procedures regularly and update as appropriate.

## Employee Responsibilities

* You must follow the relevant procedures and undertake any training required.
* You must immediately communicate any concerns with management.

# ENGLISH AS AN ADDITIONAL LANGUAGE

# LEGIONELLA

## LEGIONELLA - WHAT IS IT?

Legionellae are bacteria that can be found in natural water (*rivers, lakes etc*.) as well as artificial water systems such as hot and cold water systems (*storage tanks, pipework, taps and showers*).

Legionella can survive in low temperatures, but particularly thrive at temperatures between 20oC and 45°C. High temperatures in excess of 60°C will kill the legionella bacteria.

## LEGIONELLOSIS

Legionellosis is the collective name given to the pneumonia-like illnesses caused by legionella bacteria; including the most serious and well-known Legionnaires’ disease, and also the similar but less serious conditions of Pontiac fever and Lochgoilhead fever.

Legionnaires’ disease is a potentially fatal form of pneumonia caused by the legionella bacteria. It can affect anyone, but some are at higher risk than others; especially those over 45, smokers and heavy drinkers, those suffering from chronic respiratory or kidney disease, and people whose immune system is impaired. However, everyone is potentially susceptible.

## POTENTIAL SOURCES

Potential sources of legionella are:

* Any of the showers and taps within our premises.
* Areas in the building where the pipework is long, resulting in the water temperature dropping below 45°C.
* Any redundant pipework in the building, or any areas where stagnant water can collect and build up.
* The hot water tanks within the building.

## Duty Holder

The Duty Holder shall have access to competent advice/assistance about the risks of exposure to legionella in the water systems present at all properties. To this end, the ‘Competent Person/s’ will implement the necessary controls to prevent the proliferation of legionella bacteria, but it will be the responsibility of the ‘Responsible Person/s’ to ensure the competency of the ‘Competent Person/s’ to undertake the tasks required.

## The MD will assume the role as the ‘Duty Holder’ and their responsibilities are as follows:

* Cross Tree acts as the client and GOP Co-Living Ltd acknowledges its responsibility to consider the risks from legionella present in the water systems under its control; and is aware of the need to prevent the exposure of persons to legionella bacteria.
* The Managing Director shall undertake and assume the duties of the “Duty Holder” and will appoint a person to take on the day-to-day responsibility for controlling any identified risk from legionella bacteria; This person shall be hereafter referred to as the “Responsible Person”.
* The correct temperature is maintained in the hot water tanks.
* The Duty Holder has accountability under the Health and Safety at Work etc Act to protect the health, safety and welfare of staff, students, visitors and the public, in relation to hazards arising from its activities. This duty cannot be delegated.

* Ensure that comprehensive records are kept; this is to include legionella risk assessments, inspections and test results.
* Receive reports and advice from the “Responsible Person” regarding areas at risk of legionella, and act accordingly.
* For the management of water systems, ensure that records are kept for at least 5 years to identify occupancy of each room, and that any ‘little used outlets’ are flushed not less than once per week.
* Have in place suitable and sufficient monitoring regimes to ensure that the responsibilities of the ‘Responsible Person/s’ are being discharged.
* The ‘Duty Holder’ has protocols in place for confirmed cases of Legionella and as required by legislation will report all confirmed cases of Legionella under the Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations (RIDDOR).

## Responsible Person

The ‘Responsible Person/s’ will have sufficient authority to act on behalf of the ‘Duty Holder’ to fulfil their legal duty and will have sufficient knowledge of the water systems in place throughout the properties to ensure that all operational procedures, test and checks are carried out in the required time and within an effective manner. The ‘Responsible Person/s’ will ensure that a suitable and sufficient assessment is conducted to identify and assess the risk of exposure to legionella from work activities and water systems at all properties under the control of the Duty Holder, and any necessary precautionary measures required to reduce the risk of exposure to as low as reasonably practicable.

## The role of the ‘Responsible Person/s’ will be as follows:

* Assist in the development and implementation of the Legionella Management Plan.

# LIFTING EQUIPMENT

Lifting Equipment may be used by GOP Co-Living Ltd during its operations.

## Management Controls

* GOP Co-Living Ltd ensures that Lifting Equipment and accessories are of good construction, adequate strength, and fit for purpose in accordance with the Lifting Operations and Lifting Equipment Regulations.
* GOP Co-Living Ltd ensures that all such equipment is properly maintained and regularly examined by a competent person, and such tests and inspections are recorded.

# LONE WORKING

Within GOP Co-Living Ltd, there are a number of situations where it is possible that an employee may be called upon to work on their own. An employee working alone should never be at greater risk than any other employee at any other time. Working alone can result in risks and hazards that would otherwise be non-hazardous and not subject to a formal risk assessment.

Although instances may differ, the following guidelines are to be followed in the case of employees called upon to work alone.

## Management Controls

* Tasks in any lone worker situations are assessed, taking into account the following; is the work a one-person job? Is the location of the work remote or isolated? Is there likely to be any problems with communication? Is there any security risk, or the possibility of violence towards the lone worker? Are emergency exit routes available (consideration given to those that may be routinely locked out of hours)?
* Safe working practices and arrangements are implemented with a view to eliminating or minimising any risk.
* Staff working alone are given instructions on what to do in the event of an accident or emergency.
* Appropriate first aid resources are made available to any lone workers.

## Employee Responsibilities

* You must ensure that whilst working alone, your whereabouts and the work you are doing is known to others.
* You must ensure that the guidelines for working alone are followed.

## LIMITATIONS

***No*** member of staff will be required to work alone on behalf of GOP Co-Living Ltd in circumstances where:

* Their location is unknown.
* They do not feel confident in carrying out lone work.
* They have no means of summoning assistance or indicating their location in an emergency (including being taken ill).
* They have received no training or at least a briefing as to the potential hazards of working alone, and the measures to be taken when working alone.

## EMERGENCY SERVICES CONTACT

In an emergency, always dial **999.**

## GOP Co-Living Ltd STAFF CONTACT

Any employee likely to be in a lone working situation must ensure that they are provided with a contact telephone number of a work colleague and that the number is immediately to hand (*e.g. stored in the employees’ mobile phone memory*).

## BE AWARE OF THE ENVIRONMENT

* Know what measures are in place where you are working; check out alarm systems and procedures, exits and entrances, and the location of the first aid supplies.
* Ensure that your car and mobile phone are in good working order, and electrical and other mechanical equipment is safe to use. Check the instructions for use, and ensure that faults are reported and dealt with.
* If your work takes you into areas which are isolated, poorly lit at night, or known for high crime rates, arrange to ‘check in’ when the visit is over, or work with a partner.
* If a potentially violent situation occurs, be aware of what might be used as a weapon against you, and of possible escape routes.
* Try to maintain a comfortable level of heating and lighting in buildings you control.

## BE AWARE OF OTHER PEOPLE

* Take note of their non-verbal signals, be aware of their triggers.
* Do not crowd people; allow them space.
* Make a realistic estimate of the time you will need to complete a task; do not make promises which cannot be kept, either on your own or someone else’s behalf.
* Be aware of the context of your meeting; are persons already angry or upset before you meet, and for what reason?
* Listen to them and show them you are listening.
* Always report any incidents of violence and aggression to your Line Manager.

# MANUAL HANDLING

More than a quarter of all reportable accidents annually are associated with manual handling. Although fatalities accidents are rare, a vast majority of reported accidents result in ‘over three (3) day’ injuries.

***There are three fundamental principles:***

* As far as is reasonably practicable, hazardous manual handling activities should be avoided.
* If unavoidable, then a risk assessment of the hazardous manual handling activity must be undertaken.
* Following the assessment, the risk of injury should be reduced to as low as is reasonably practicable.

## Management Controls

* Assessments for manual handling activities are recorded and reviewed.
* Wherever possible, we avoid employees undertaking unnecessary manual handling activities that involve risks.
* Employees are provided with information and guidance with regard to correct handling and lifting techniques.
* Employees are provided with appropriate training and suitable personal protective equipment.
* If a task has to be undertaken in the knowledge of the risk, employees are informed of the weight of the load and the centre of gravity (if not central).

## Employee Responsibilities

* Follow and comply with any system developed to ensure safe manual handling techniques.
* Use any personal protective equipment provided.
* Practice safe work habits.
* Report any hazard or defect.

## Safety checklist Manual handling and lifting

## Preparation

* What is being lifted?
* Where to and how far?
* How many people will be needed to move the load safely?
* Are they all trained in kinetic lifting and handling?
* What methods and equipment will be required?
* Is the required equipment available?
* Would mechanical means be more practical or appropriate?
* Is the lifting and handling area/route clear of hazards?
* Is the operation part of a routine? If so, could it be more effectively planned and executed?

## Lifting and handling

* Is the proper clothing in use?
* Are proper (*kinetic*) lifting methods being employed?
* Is co-ordination satisfactory in dual and team lifting?
* Is the necessary equipment in use or to hand?
* Are excessively heavy weights being lifted?
* Are loads being deposited or stacked safely and securely?
* Is adequate supervision employed where necessary?

## After lifting and handling

* Are any incidents or accidents reported and recorded?
* Where injuries have been sustained, has medical attention been sought?
* Is the damage or loss of equipment etc. recorded?

## Guideline Weights for Manual handling Operations

![](data:image/png;base64...)

*Each box in the diagram above shows guideline weights for lifting and lowering.*

Observe the activity and compare to the diagram. If the lifter’s hands enter more than one box during the operation, use the smallest weight. Use an in-between weight if the hands are close to a boundary between boxes. If the operation must take place with the hands beyond the boxes, make a more detailed assessment.

The weights assume that the load is readily grasped with both hands.

The operation takes place in reasonable working conditions with the lifter in a stable body position.

Any operation involving more than twice the guideline weights should be rigorously assessed –even for very fit, well-trained individuals working under favourable conditions.

There is no such thing as a completely ‘safe’ manual handling operation. But working within the guidelines will cut the risk and reduce the need for a more detailed assessment.

## Emergencies

Well-intentioned improvisation in an emergency, for example to rescue a casualty, does not amount to a breach of these Regulations.

# MENTAL HEALTH & WELLBEING

GOP Co-Living Ltd is committed to protecting the health (*mental health as well as physical health*), safety and welfare of its employees (*this extends to contractors and temporary staff*) by providing a supportive working environment.

Mental ill health and stress are associated with many of the leading causes of disease and disability in our society. Promoting and protecting the mental wellbeing of the workforce is important for individuals’ physical health, social wellbeing, and productivity. Many factors in the workplace influence the mental wellbeing of individual employees, particular departments or organisations as a whole. Understanding and addressing the factors which affect people’s mental wellbeing at work has a wide range of benefits, both for individuals and the organisation.

Mental wellbeing in the workplace is relevant to all employees and everyone can contribute to improved mental wellbeing at work. Addressing workplace mental wellbeing can help strengthen the positive, protective factors of employment, reduce risk factors for mental ill health and improve general health. It can also help promote the employment of people who have experienced mental health problems and support them once they are at work. This workplace mental wellbeing policy covers the following aspects of mental health and wellbeing:

It is the policy of GOP Co-Living Ltd to provide a supportive environment for dealing with mental health related issues; however, employees must take responsibility for raising their concerns as early as possible in order for GOP Co-Living Ltd to investigate and assist with or resolve genuine problems.

Some pressure at work is inevitable and total elimination of this pressure is neither possible nor desirable. Every job brings its own set of tasks, responsibilities and day-to-day problems. The pressures and demands these place upon employees are an unavoidable feature in working life.

Some pressure can be positive. It is often the tasks and challenges faced at work that provide the structure to the working day and keep individuals motivated. These are often key in providing a sense of achievement and job satisfaction. However, an individual’s ability to deal with pressure is not limitless and it is important that this pressure does not become sustained stress. It must be recognised that different people have different stress thresholds.

Work-related stress is not an illness in itself, but excessive workplace pressure can potentially cause damage to the mental wellbeing of an individual, and this can in turn undermine the health of the workforce and damage business performance.

Some of the most common causes of work-related stress are known to be excessive workloads, deadline pressures, aggressive management, poor communication, unsupportive work environments and problems maintaining work-life balance.

Outside domestic pressures, such as family, finance, and bereavement are also potential causes of stress and can frequently compound workplace pressure. These should also be taken into consideration where they are likely to have an impact on an individual at work.

## Management Controls

GOP Co-Living Ltd has responsibility for:

* Encouraging active consideration of mental wellbeing as part of the design and implementation of procedures, processes or systems (for example when defining roles and responsibilities within their department).
* Endeavouring to take reasonable actions to investigate the issues and reduce or eliminate the factors causing stress where reasonably practicable and appropriate (support will be provided to the manager dealing with the issue by the relevant Health & Safety Advisor or other appropriate persons as required).
* Raising the awareness about mental health and wellbeing.
* Where reasonable and practical, producing and making changes to work-related practices to reduce the factors which may lead to stress in the workplace (for example, workplace risk assessments and audits, providing staff with training and adequate resources for their roles).
* Providing opportunities for employees to maintain and promote their health and well-being.
* Promoting and maintaining a culture of open communication throughout the organisation.
* Promoting and maintaining good management and team building practices for those with management and supervisory responsibilities.

Dealing with existing or potential mental health problems by:

* Providing a supportive environment in which issues and concerns can be raised in confidence and dealt with appropriately.
* Providing guidance to managers to assist in the sensitive management of employees in likely harmful situations.
* Identifying appropriate training requirements.
* Assisting and advising employees who are suffering from work-related stress.
* Providing signposting to both internal and external sources of assistance for employees with potential mental ill health (the level and type of assistance will depend on individual circumstances).

## Employee Responsibilities

* Ensure concerns regarding mental health and wellbeing are raised to your immediate Manager in the first instance as early as possible. Where this is not appropriate, concerns should be raised with another Manager.
* Seek appropriate medical advice and/or advice from appropriate organisations.

# MONITORING, AUDITING AND REVIEW

GOP Co-Living Ltd will provide, so far as is reasonably practicable, a safe and healthy working environment at all times. To maintain and improve Health and Safety standards, GOP Co-Living Ltd will ensure adequate arrangements are in place to monitor and review health and safety in the workplace. Where the monitoring or review processes identify that improvements need to be made in the health and safety arrangements, GOP Co-Living Ltd will ensure that suitable and timely action is taken to make improvements.

To meet the requirements of the above, GOP Co-Living Ltd shall:

* Ensure that work areas are monitored regularly, with written audits completed at least quarterly.
* Co-operate with any health and safety audits/inspections undertaken by others in their area.
* Agree with the person undertaking the audit/inspection the findings and any remedial action needed.
* Ensure all agreed actions are completed in an appropriate and timely way as agreed.
* Set up arrangements to monitor and review health and safety performance in their own area of responsibility.
* Ensure all safety related incidents are recorded and investigated as appropriate.
* Track significant actions arising from incident investigations, audits and inspections.
* Monitor the effectiveness of site inspections.
* Monitor the effectiveness of health and safety training programmes.
* Ensure audits are led by someone who is suitably competent.
* Ensure that the review of Health & Safety Management Systems is completed at least annually, or sooner if changes or the result of audits dictate.

# PERSONAL ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT

The leads and plugs of electrical equipment, or sometimes the equipment itself, can be damaged with use which may result in an electric shock. Electric shocks can cause severe and permanent injuries and can kill. Damaged equipment can cause fires that can lead to death or injury to others. Most of these accidents can be avoided by adopting a policy with straightforward precautions. The aim of this policy is to reduce the risks which non-company electrical equipment may pose to all staff and persons visiting or working within the demised premises of the company.

The company recognises that with the ever-increasing pace of technology and for reasons of personal safety, staff and contractors may wish to bring certain personal electrical devices to work. Employees are permitted to bring in and use the following personal equipment:

* Mobile/smart phones/tablets and chargers.
* Digital organisers and chargers.
* iPhones, iPods, and MP3 players.

Employees and contractors are not permitted to bring into the workplace any other privately-owned electrical equipment that requires a mains power supply to run or charge the equipment. Staff and contractors found with any items of electrical equipment which are not allowed in the workplace will be asked to remove the equipment from the premises.

Contractors and delegates may be required to bring in personal/company owned, work-related equipment. The equipment must be required for carrying out their work and they must ensure that this equipment is in a safe condition by verifying the following:

* The plug or adaptor is for a UK socket.
* The cable and body of the equipment and/or charger do not show any signs of damage.
* All UK plugs are mGOPed BS 1363.
* The equipment or charger is Class II (Double Insulated) & CE (European Standard) or UKCA (UK Standard) mGOPed.

Contractors must have their equipment PAT tested regularly to demonstrate that it is in a safe condition. They are also responsible for carrying out visual inspections of their equipment between tests. Equipment that has not been PAT tested or equipment which is faulty or non-compliant must not be brought on site.

# PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT

The Regulations regarding Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) deal with clothing and equipment designed to protect employees from external influence (*but does not include equipment or clothing required by other legislation such as C.O.S.H.H. or Food Hygiene*). The equipment provided should be suitable for the risks involved and the conditions at the place where exposure to the risk may occur. It is also important that the equipment is suitable for the person who is required to wear it and does not induce any unnecessary stress when in use. PPE will be provided free of charge if an assessment has indicated that PPE is required to be worn.

## Management Controls

* We assess our work activities to determine whether PPE is appropriate and necessary. The assessment will determine; What PPE is required? Is the PPE compatible with other equipment that has to be used or worn for that task? Does the PPE create any additional risks itself?
* GOP Co-Living Ltd provide PPE to employees if they are exposed to any risks that cannot be controlled by other means.
* We will also provide suitable training on how and when to use the PPE provided.
* We recognise that PPE may become damaged or defective through normal ‘wear and tear’, and on such occasions, we will remove and replace the PPE. Where PPE becomes damaged or defective through wilful neglect or misuse, employees will be required to contribute to or cover the cost of repair or replacement.

## Employee Responsibilities

* You must always wear the PPE provided.
* You must inform Management if you believe for any reason that the PPE provided is unsuitable for the task or creates additional risks.
* You must take all reasonable care of PPE provided to you, including regular appropriate cleaning.
* You must check PPE before use and report it to Management for replacement if it is found to be damaged or defective.

# PORTABLE APPLIANCE TESTING

## Inspection

In most cases, inspection is a simple visual technique that does not need to be carried out by a trained electrical expert.

## Testing

Testing is carried out by a competent person and involves a full inspection of the electrical equipment along with appropriate tests. Individuals who carry out the testing should possess sufficient knowledge, experience and training in order for them to identify the risks and appropriate control measures.

## Combined Inspection and Testing

A combination of inspection and testing should be carried out by a competent electrician where there is reason to suspect electrical equipment may be faulty or damaged.

## Management Controls

* Where Testing is required, a competent electrician is engaged in accordance with our policy on Contractor selection.
* Records of all Portable Electrical Appliance testing will be kept on the premises and will be available for inspection when required.
* Any defective equipment will be placed out of use until such time as it can be repaired, with all remedial action/s being recorded. All items of equipment that cannot be repaired will be withdrawn from use and disposed of accordingly.

## Employee Responsibilities

* Before using any item of electrical equipment, carry out a visual check of the plug along with the connected cable, which should be gripped securely at the plug.
* At the first sign of damage or excessive wear, report the item to Management to be removed from use and isolated until it can be checked by a competent electrician, repaired or replaced.

# PROTECTION OF THE PUBLIC

## Public Visiting Premises

Members of the public (*this may include children*) enter the Canary Warf premises on a regular basis to visit the café.

# R.I.D.D.O.R.

## (Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences)

GOP Co-Living Ltd has a duty to prevent, as far as is reasonably practicable, accidents at work. However, despite the best efforts and intentions, accidents at work may still occur.

## Management Controls

* If an accident or dangerous occurrence does occur, the following procedure is followed:
* Ensure that the victim receives the correct medical attention and that any residual hazard is safely removed if necessary and as appropriate;
* Ensure that an investigation is undertaken to prevent the accident recurring;
* Ensure the incident is reported to the correct authority as required.
* GOP Co-Living Ltd is responsible for investigating the accident/dangerous occurrence and completing the appropriate documentation. Details of all reportable accidents and injuries must be kept for at least three (3) years and record the following:
* Date and time of the accident or dangerous occurrence;
* Full name and occupation of the victim/s, with details of the nature of the injuries or other related condition suffered;
* Where the accident/dangerous occurrence happened;
* Description of the circumstances surrounding the accident or occurrence.

## Employee Responsibilities

* You must cooperate fully with GOP Co-Living Ltd in the gathering and recording of details regarding accidents, incidents and near misses.
* You must always report any event that may be considered an accident, incident or near miss.

## Reportable accidents and occurrences

Determining whether a particular incident or accident should be reported can be confusing. The following **must** be reported:

* Deaths.
* Specified reportable injuries.
* Accidents resulting in over seven (7) day injury to an employee.
* Reportable diseases.
* Reportable dangerous occurrences.
* Gas incidents.

## Death or SPECIFIED injurIES

If there is an accident connected with work and;

* an employee, or a self-employed person working on our premises is killed or suffers a specific injury (*including as a result of physical violence*); *or*
* a member of the public is killed or taken to hospital;

the HSE Incident Contact Centre **must** be informed without delay, either via telephone or completion of the appropriate form on the HSE website.

## Reportable SPECIFIED injuries:

Specified injuries are classified as:

* Fractures, other than to fingers, thumbs and toes.
* Bone fractures including a break, crack or chip.
* Amputation of an arm, hand, finger, thumb, leg, foot or toe.
* Any injury likely to lead to permanent loss of sight or reduction in sight in one or both eyes.
* Any crush injury to the head or torso, causing damage to the brain or internal organs.
* Any burn injury (including scalding) which:
* covers more than 10% of the whole body’s total surface area; *or*
* causes significant damage to the eyes, respiratory system or other vital organs.
* Any degree of scalping requiring hospital treatment.
* Any loss of consciousness caused by head injury or asphyxia.
* Asphyxia (lack of oxygen) may happen when a person enters an oxygen-deficient atmosphere, such as a confined space, or are exposed to poisonous gases, e.g. carbon monoxide.
* Any other injury arising from working in an enclosed space which:
* leads to hypothermia or heat-induced illness; *or*
* requires resuscitation or admittance to hospital for more than twenty-four (24) hours.

In some cases, employers and self-employed workers may not be in a position to know the full extent of an injury, (e.g. when a prognosis has not yet been established in relation to an eye injury, or when efforts are being made to treat an injured limb which may ultimately require surgical amputation). In such situations, there is no requirement to make precautionary reports of specified injuries. However, it is likely that the accident will require reporting due to the injured person being incapacitated for more than seven (7) days. The enforcing authority should be notified or updated as soon as a specified injury has been confirmed.

## OVER SEVEN-DAY INJURY

You **must** report injuries that lead to a worker being incapacitated **for more than seven (7) consecutive days** as the result of an occupational accident or injury (not counting the day of the accident but including weekends and rest days). **The report must be made within fifteen (15) days of the accident.** Incapacitation means that the worker is absent or is unable to do work that they would reasonably be expected to do as part of their normal work. You must still keep a record of the accident if the worker has been incapacitated **for more than three (3) consecutive days.**

## Reportable Diseases

If a doctor determines that an employee is suffering from a reportable work-related disease, then the details must be reported. Reportable diseases include:

* Certain poisonings.
* Some skin diseases.
* Lung diseases, including occupational asthma, pneumoconiosis, asbestosis.
* Infections such as hepatitis; tuberculosis; legionellosis and tetanus.
* Other conditions, such as occupational cancer; certain musculoskeletal disorders; decompression illness and hand-arm vibration syndrome.

## Reportable Dangerous Occurrences

If something happens that, although it may not have resulted in a reportable injury, clearly could have done; it may be a dangerous occurrence. This must be reported to the HSE Incident Contact Centre immediately. Reportable dangerous occurrences include:

* Explosion, collapse or bursting of any closed vessel or associated pipe work.
* Electrical short circuit or overload causing fire or explosion.
* Accidental release of a biological agent likely to cause severe human illness, or any substance likely to be harmful to health.
* Collapse or partial collapse of a scaffold over five metres high.
* Unintended collapse of any building or structure under construction.
* Explosion or fire causing suspension of normal work for over twenty-four (24) hours.

# RISK ASSESSMENTS

## General Principles

Where five or more persons are employed, health and safety legislation requires written risk assessments of hazards and risks to be undertaken, and the findings to be brought to the attention of those who might be affected by the associated hazard or risk.

Assessments are to be undertaken by a trained and competent person, being "*a person having the necessary training, qualifications, and relevant practical experience concerning the task being assessed*". There is no such thing as a risk-free workplace, but you can minimise threats to health and safety through risk assessment.

## Management Controls

* We assess all processes that have the potential to cause harm.
* Completed assessments are made available to all employees.
* Risk Assessments are periodically monitored, to ensure their continued relevance and suitability.

## Employee Responsibilities

* You must adhere to and comply with all measures identified by Risk Assessments.
* You must stop work and liaise with management if the hazards change or controls are not sufficient.

## Five Steps to Risk Assessments

The following five steps are the key:

## [Step 1:](http://www.pmmda.org.uk/HSE%20Risk%20Assessment.htm#step1#step1) WHAT?

Identify the hazards which could cause harm. Key hazards include:

* Slipping or tripping hazards, (e.g. uneven or wet floors, cabling).
* Fire risks.
* Chemicals, fumes, dust.
* Machinery, portable appliances.
* Working at height, (e.g. from mezzanine floors, scaffolding).
* Vehicles, forklift trucks.
* Electricity.
* Manual handling, lifting, carrying.
* Noise pollution.
* Poor lighting.
* Low (or high) temperature.

## [Step 2:](http://www.pmmda.org.uk/HSE%20Risk%20Assessment.htm#step2#step2) WHO?

Decide who the people, or groups of people, are that might be affected by the hazard, for instance:

* Office staff.
* Maintenance staff and operatives.
* Contractors and Cleaners.
* Visitors or members of the public.

**Remember** to consider those people or groups that might be more vulnerable, and therefore at greater risk, such as disabled persons, young persons, new or expectant mothers, visitors, inexperienced/ temporary staff, lone workers.

## [Step 3:](http://www.pmmda.org.uk/HSE%20Risk%20Assessment.htm#step3#step3) HOW?

Evaluate precautions that are in place, or need to be put in place; how can the risks be eliminated, reduced or minimised?

* By complying with recognised industry quality standards?
* By removing the source of the hazard completely?
* By introducing and maintaining good housekeeping?
* Accepting the risk, but reducing it as far as possible?

Have you ensured that you:

* Have provided adequate information?
* Have arranged sufficient relevant training?
* Have effective systems or procedures?
* Have clear organisational responsibilities?

## [Step 4:](http://www.pmmda.org.uk/HSE%20Risk%20Assessment.htm#step3#step3) RECORD

Keep records of assessments:

* Record when the assessment was done.
* Record what risks were identified.
* Indicate what precautions are in place.
* Indicate what additional precautions are needed.
* Create an Action Plan, together with a timescale or schedule, to work to.
* Keep the Record of Assessment easily to hand, so that it can be amended as changes occur.

## [Step 5:](http://www.pmmda.org.uk/HSE%20Risk%20Assessment.htm#step3#step3) REVIEW

Ensure effective monitoring of assessments:

* Remove complacency.
* Regularly review and update your hazard precautions.
* Identify those areas that remain a problem, and take steps to amend and improve.
* Be aware of changes in the workplace that may reduce the effectiveness of your assessment (*e.g. new machinery, change of process or personnel etc*.).
* Be prepared to adjust and reappraise.

# SIGNS AND NOTICES

Under statutory legislation certain signs and notices must be displayed in prominent positions around the premises. Those signs that convey a safety message must do so pictorially as well as in writing, to ensure that the information can be understood by all those within the premises.

# SPA EQUIPMENT

**How to use the spa area facilities correctly**

If in doubt all customers should contact a doctor before using any of the spa facilities. When using any of these facilities customers should:

* Change into and remain wearing appropriate swim wear at all times.
* Belongings should be placed in a locker and the locker locked afterwards.
* Remove any metal in the form of watches and jewellery as the facilities become very hot.
* Have a thorough warm shower before using the facilities.
* Not go from one facility to another without allowing body temperature to fall back to a comfortable level.
* Not use facilities for longer than 15 minutes without allowing their body temperature to return to a comfortable level.
* Leave facilities if the heat starts to become uncomfortable and cool off by either taking a cool shower or over a prolonged period in the relaxation area.
* Not return to a facility for longer than 10 minutes if they have had to leave through uncomfortable temperatures.
* Keep hydrated by drinking water.
* Contact a member of staff immediately if they feel any ill effects.

**Spa area: contraindications for use**

The spa area facilities **must not** be used by a customer if:

* They have had (or are currently suffering from) a serious illness. Have a heart condition, high or low blood pressure, a respiratory condition or any other medical condition which may affect their reaction to excess heat or rapid changed in temperature.
* Are taking any medication for any of the above conditions or they are unsure as to the advisability of using saunas.
* Have a contagious disease, infectious skin condition, open sores or wounds.
* Have an illness causing an inability to perspire.
* Have had a heavy meal within one and a half hours.
* They are under the influence or alcohol or drugs.
* They have recently exercised (time must be given to allow their body temperature to lower).

**Spa area rules**

* Users are **NOT** allowed to shave/dye hair/exfoliate anywhere within the spa premises.
* **NO** oils/essence/shampoo/body wash to be used anywhere other than the shower area.
* Suitable swimwear **MUST** be worn at all times.
* Appropriate behavior **MUST** be adhered to at all times.

**Safe plant operation**

* Only suitably trained person(s) should operate the plant for the spa.

## SAUNA

The Sauna consists of an insulated enclosure made of wood, together with heat generating equipment. Benches are provided within the sauna enclosure. The Sauna provides a dry heat with temperatures ranging from 85ºC to 100ºC.

The higher benches in the sauna are the hottest place to sit. Users should not wear contact lenses or any form of jewellery whist using the sauna facilities.

Water should not be added to the heating element or the thermostat as it may damage equipment. If users require more water adding to the hot stones they should contact a member of staff.

Textiles such as clothing and towels should not be left in the sauna.

## STEAM ROOM

The steam room consists of an enclosure made of an impervious material and steam generating equipment. The steam room operates at temperatures of around 50ºC regulated by a thermostat with relative humidity of 80 to 100%. They produce a wet humid heat and are intended for indoor use.

Users should not wear contact lenses or any form of jewellery whist using the steam room facilities.

Water should not be added to the heating element or the thermostat as it may damage equipment.

The steam generator should be checked for scale every month and de-scaled accordingly. A record should be kept of this.

## SPA POOL

The spa pool is heated to 37-40 ºC and works on a timer. Due to high temperatures the chlorine levels are kept higher in the Spa Pool which may cause irritation to sensitive skin. The Spa pool should either be drained and re-filled or backwashed on a daily basis.

* Users should not wear loose fitting clothing.
* Users should have a shower prior to entering the spa pool.
* Users should not wear contact lenses or any form of jewellery whist using the spa pool.
* Clothing must not be washed or left in the spa pool.
* Chemicals of any kind **must not** be added to the spa pool water.

If the spa pool starts to develop foam a small amount of ‘no foam’ should be added.

**CHLORINE AND PH**

In order to ensure the safety of users it is essential that the temperature, chlorine and pH levels are maintained within acceptable parameters. Where an automatic dosing system is in place, checks should be completed (as a minimum) three times per day at equal frequencies. Where manual dosing is in place, checks and associated rectifying actions must be completed (as a minimum) every two hours.

**Acceptable range**

If results are outside of these readings then the pool must be closed and corrective action taken. A second pool test must be completed before reopening the pool.

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Pool** | **Free Chlorine (DPD 1)** | | **pH (Phenol Red)** | |
| Lower | Upper | Lower | Upper |
| Plunge | 2.0 | 4.0 | 7.0 | 7.6 |
| Spa | 3.0 | 5.0 | 7.0 | 7.6 |

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Pool** | **Free Chlorine (DPD 1)** | | **Combined Chlorine (DPD 3- DPD 1)** | | **pH (Phenol Red)** | |
| Lower | Upper | Lower | Upper | Lower | Upper |
| Plunge | 2.5 | 3.5 | 0.0 | 0.5 | 7.1 | 7.3 |
| Spa | 3.5 | 4.5 | 0.0 | 0.5 | 7.1 | 7.3 |

**Ideal readings**

The below readings are what you should be aiming to always maintain through dosing, cleaning and backwashing.

* Water samples should be taken directly from the pool from a depth of at least elbow deep.
* When taking samples the tubes should first be rinsed then filled back up again.

**Where a dosing system is in place:**

The spa pool runs on an automatic dosing system. It is therefore important that once the above checks have been completed, the readings are compared to the control unit for the dosing system.

Where readings have a variance greater than +/- 0.2ppm for chlorine or +/- 0.1 for the pH then the dosing system should be re-calibrated. It is important not to over-calibrate the control unit as this can cause the unit to overcompensate, remember due to the water flow rate there may be a slight difference between the pool water and the water in the dosing system.

**Where manual dosing is being completed**

NOTE: This section can also be used in the event that the spa pool dosing system is faulty.

**Do not** add chemicals in hot environments, or use chlorinated water in steam rooms as Chlorine gas may be released.

**Do not** add chemicals into the pools whilst it is in use. You must close the pool first and give the chemicals time to mix before allowing users back in.

**You must not** mix chlorine products. Therefore, always dose with the same products (eg, Sodium Hypochloride). Where manual dosing is being completed you **must** use the same product that is used by the dosing system.

**Important Safety Notice - Do Not allow chlorine and acids to mix as this can cause the release of toxic gasses. Therefore, never add both chlorine and pH reducer to the water at the same time.**

# TRAINING & SUPERVISION

GOP Co-Living Ltd is committed to maintaining and developing standards of excellence in all aspects of its business. To that end, we aspire to deliver high standards of health and safety management and recognise that training and development at all levels is a key contributor in delivering those standards, both in terms of health and safety as well as occupational training. Safety training is cost effective and is proven to reduce accidents at work. GOP Co-Living Ltd has a duty to provide information, instruction, training and supervision to all employees to ensure their health, safety and welfare whilst they are at work.

Providing appropriate information, instruction and training will:

* Ensure staff and subcontractors are capable of undertaking their duties in an effective and efficient manner in accordance with legislation.
* Develop a positive working environment, where safe and healthy working environments and working procedures contribute towards effective and efficient operational processes.
* Reduce the risk of staff, subcontractors and visitors etc. being injured or made ill as a result of our activities, and thereby reduce the financial costs of accidents and ill health.
* Meet our legal duty of care to protect the health and safety of staff, subcontractors, visitors and anyone else who may be affected by our activities.

## Duties under the Law:

The Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 places a legal duty on GOP Co-Living Ltd to ensure that staff at all levels are “competent” to undertake their duties. Competency is usually acquired through the provision of adequate information, instruction, training and supervision, plus relevant experience. However competency cannot be achieved by experience alone and therefore a structured programme of information, instruction and training is essential to ensure competency.

This legal duty is expanded on by the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999, which identifies situations where health and safety training is particularly important e.g.

* On appointment.
* On transferring or being promoted to a new post.
* Where there may be significant changes to the working environment.
* Where there may be significant changes to the work activity, or the work equipment.
* When technology changes.
* Where people may be exposed to new or increased risks.
* Where existing knowledge and skills may need updating.

## Definitions

There is no legal definition of the terms “information, instruction, training, competence and supervision”. The terms are intrinsically linked:

* **Information** means providing factual material which tells people about potential hazards and risks, and appropriate health and safety measures to minimise those risks.
* **Instruction** means telling people what they should do; and Training means helping people to learn how to do something. This might be through a combination of the following:
* provision of written information;
* a classroom presentation;
* demonstrating a task or procedure.
* **Competence** can be described as the combination of training, skills, experience and knowledge that a person has and their ability to apply them to perform a task safely. This must be assessed, following training, by a competent person using any of or a combination of the following :
* Written test/exam (e.g. induction information);
* Verbal discussion/questioning;
* Observation (usually for practical tasks).
* **Supervision** is the process of ongoing monitoring the effectiveness of the training that people have received, and whether they maintain the necessary capacity and competence to do the job.

## Management Controls

* We ensure all employees are suitably trained to implement and comply with the Health and Safety policy.
* Employees are trained to undertake specific tasks in relation to their job function, regardless of the location where the work is being carried out.

**Objectives**

1. The Company is committed to continuous improvement of waste management practices and a reduction in the proportion of waste sent to landfill.
2. Reduce at Source – using and discarding less material generally, segregating wastes and asking suppliers to take back packaging and re-usable containers.
3. Re-use and Repair – passing on to others re-usable chemicals and equipment no longer required and repairing in preference to replacing equipment where appropriate.
4. Recycle – separating materials for recycling – such as mixed waste paper, cardboard, cans, printer consumables and waste electrical and electronic equipment.
5. Responsibly Dispose – complying with the Environmental Protection Act 1990 Duty of Care.
6. Licenced Waste Disposal - Only use a licenced company to transfer waste recorded on transfer notes.
7. Provide the necessary awareness and training to enable staff at all levels to understand and contribute to the implementation of this policy.

**To achieve its objectives the company is committed to:**

* Prevent pollution, reduce waste and to maximise the efficient use of materials and energy.
* Use sustainable, reusable or recyclable products where technically and economically viable.
* Ensure that all wastes, particularly hazardous or contaminated wastes, are tested, transported and disposed of in an environmentally acceptable manner, in accordance with statutory duty of care requirements.
